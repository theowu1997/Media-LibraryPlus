# MediaLibrary Plus

MediaLibrary Plus is a Windows desktop app for organizing and browsing local video libraries, with a focus on JAV collections. It scans folders, filters supported video files, generates poster-based browsing views, organizes files into Normal and Gentle Mode workspaces, and provides a built-in player with subtitle support.

## What the app does

- Scans local folders for video files
- Filters supported media before importing
- Builds a browsable video library with poster cards
- Organizes content into Normal Mode and Gentle Mode
- Moves and renames video files using configurable templates
- Groups imported titles by actress
- Plays videos inside the app with subtitle search and local subtitle loading
- Manages library roots, subtitle folders, poster generation, and player preferences from Settings
- Supports TMDB title-based metadata fallback when the non-commercial use checkbox is enabled

## How the library works

- The app scans local video files from configured roots
- It validates files before import
- It prefers complete and higher-quality files when duplicates exist
- It parses video IDs and metadata from filenames
- It can fetch posters and actress metadata from online sources
- TMDB fallback is optional and requires explicit non-commercial use acknowledgment
- It generates local poster frames when needed
- It stores library records in a local SQLite database
- It keeps Normal Mode and Gentle Mode collections separate

## Library organization

MediaLibrary Plus uses configurable naming templates so imported files can be moved into a consistent folder structure. The app can organize files by title, actress, year, video ID, and other tokens defined in Settings.

Typical behavior:

- Scan local media
- Parse metadata from filenames
- Determine the target mode
- Move and rename the video
- Move matching subtitle files
- Write library metadata files where configured
- Clean up empty folders after moves

## Subtitle support

- Auto-match local subtitle files during import
- Import subtitle files from configured subtitle directories
- Search online subtitles from SubtitleCat
- Download subtitles in the selected language
- Apply downloaded subtitles in the built-in player

## Gentle Mode

Gentle Mode is protected by a shortcut-based unlock flow.

- Default unlock shortcut: `Ctrl+Alt+D`
- Unlock applies to the current app session
- Gentle Mode content stays separate from Normal Mode content
- Gentle files are only fully accessible after unlock

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Scripts

- `npm run dev` - start the Electron development flow
- `npm run build` - type-check and build the app
- `npm start` - launch the packaged Electron app
- `npm test` - run the Vitest unit suite
- `npm run test:e2e` - run the Playwright end-to-end suite

## Git troubleshooting

If Git commands fail with a worktree path error (broken `.git` pointer), see `docs/git-repair.md`.

## Notes

- The app is Windows-first and uses Electron
- It stores its local database in the Electron user-data directory
- Metadata and poster fetching rely on online services and can fail if those services are unavailable
- TMDB usage is intended for free non-commercial projects with attribution
- Some UI items described in the product vision may still be partial or roadmap-only
